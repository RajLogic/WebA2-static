                <p>
                    Phillip Island is a popular day trip from Melbourne, located just 90 minutes from the city. The
                    island
                    is home to the famous Penguin Parade, where you can watch hundreds of little penguins waddle up the
                    beach at sunset. Phillip Island is also home to the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix, held at the
                    Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit. The island is a great place to spot wildlife, with koalas,
                    kangaroos,
                    and seals all calling the island home.

                    The You Yangs are a series of granite peaks located just outside of Melbourne. The You Yangs
                    Regional
                    Park is a popular destination for bushwalking, mountain biking, and rock climbing. The park is home
                    to a
                    variety of wildlife, including kangaroos, wallabies, and echidnas. The You Yangs are a great place
                    to
                    escape the city and enjoy the great outdoors. The park offers stunning views of the surrounding
                    plains

                <p>
                    The Great Ocean Road is one of Australia's most famous scenic drives, stretching for over 240
                    kilometres along the south-east coast of Victoria. The road winds its way along the coast, passing
                    through picturesque seaside towns, lush rainforests, and stunning beaches. The Great Ocean Road is
                    home
                    to the famous Twelve Apostles, a series of limestone rock formations that rise out of the ocean. The
                    Great Ocean Road is a must-see destination for anyone visiting Victoria.
